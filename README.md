# Weather App

Weather App with City Information

## Project Description

This project is a weather application that allows users to retrieve weather information for a specific city. It utilizes the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch weather data and the OpenAI API to generate additional information about the city using natural language processing.

The application is built using Python, Flask framework, HTML, and CSS. It provides a user-friendly interface where users can enter a city name and get real-time weather data, along with additional city information generated by the ChatGPT API.

- OpenAI API

## Installation & Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.

### Setting up the Flask Environment

1. Create a virtual environment to isolate the project dependencies (optional but recommended).
2. Activate the virtual environment.
3. Install the required dependencies by running the following command: `pip install -r requirements.txt`


### Running the Application

1. Obtain an API key from the OpenWeatherMap API by signing up on their website.
2. Replace `'OPENWEATHER_API_KEY'` in the `get_weather` function in `app.py` with your actual API key.
3. (Optional) Obtain an API key from the OpenAI API if you wish to use the ChatGPT city information feature. Replace `'OPENAI_API_KEY'` in the `get_city_info` function in `app.py` with your actual API key.
4. Save the changes in `app.py`.

To run the application:

1. In the terminal, navigate to the project directory.
2. Run the following command: `python app.py`
3. Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:5000` to access the weather application.

## How to Use the Project

1. Enter the name of a city in the provided input field.
2. Click the "Go" button to retrieve the weather information for the specified city.
3. The weather details, including temperature, humidity, and description, will be displayed.
4. If the ChatGPT API is configured correctly, additional information about the city generated by the ChatGPT model will be shown below the weather details.


> Note: The availability and functionality of the ChatGPT API may have limitations or usage restrictions depending on your access level and OpenAI's policies.
